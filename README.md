## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

To build a Chrome extension that runs on LinkedIn and assists users in generating replies to messages. This is a demo extension, so  

there's no need to make actual API calls for generating responses.


## <a name="tech-stack">⚙️ Tech Stack</a>

- React
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS

  

## <a name="features">🔋 Tasks</a>


👉  Show the AI icon when the user focuses on the LinkedIn message input field.

👉  The icon should disappear when the input field is no longer focused.

👉  Display a center-aligned modal when clicking on the icon .

👉 Clicking anywhere outside this modal should close it.

👉  The user can enter any command in the modal's input field.

👉 Clicking on the “Generate” button should just display this dummy response: `Thank you for the opportunity! If you have any more 

questions or if there's anything else I can help you with, feel free to ask.` 

    1. The “Regenerate” button should be non-functional *.*

👉 When the user clicks on the insert button, the generated static text should be inserted properly into the message input field

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Typescript]
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)


**Constraints**

- You must use [**WXT Framework**](https://wxt.dev/) for building the extension. This demonstrates that you are capable of learning new frameworks quickly.
- You must use `React` with `TypeScript`.
- You must use `Tailwind CSS` for styling.
- Avoid using any other third-party libraries for UI or icons. In Figma, you can click on an icon and export it as an SVG.
- Don't do anything extra that is not part of the required task. Instead, if you have some time left, focus on handling any edge cases and improving code quality.


  **Code Quality**
    
    *There are numerous ways to solve this assignment, and none of them are wrong. We are looking for a candidate who knows which solution is better than the others.*
    
    **Qualities of good code:**
    
    1. **Readable**
        - Code is [Organized](https://gourav.io/blog/organize-code) and [Linear](https://gourav.io/blog/linear-code).
        - Descriptive naming of variables, functions, etc. Follows naming convention.
        - Comments are added wherever necessary.
        
    2. **Performant**
        
        The code should be optimized for performance where necessary, without sacrificing readability.
        
    3. **Failproof**
        - Consideration of edge cases (Make sure to thoroughly test your code for any subtle bugs).
        - Error handling.

    4. **Extensible**
        
        Easy to modify and extend by you and others when needed.
